# Nio

## Your CodeOps assistant

Nio is a CodeOps automation eco-system aiming to take developers from zero to production and back into maintenance iterations as quickly and painlessly as possible.

With the explosion of platforms, languages, tools, capabilities and libraries; shipping features can easily become a mine field and massive amounts of effort before even writing a line of actual product code.

Nio aims to provide a hackable convention based platform for product development, automating as much of the process as possible.

Think of Nio as your own set of Dr Octopus's crazy arms coupled with an army of bots to do the work you shouldn't do.

## Nio concepts

Nio introduces some concepts to the product development space to make automation as predictable as possible.
These concepts translate into physical folders, files and running processes.

### hangar

The hangar is the root project folder for cloud based products. Similar to the physical structure of its namesake, the hangar houses all the materials, tools, cargo and personnel to construct and maintain products and ship them as cargo to the cloud.

A hangar folder can be named anything, but should contain the following:

#### bots

TODO

#### cargo

TODO

#### products

TODO

#### shelter

### homeland
